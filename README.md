FlightStats Learning
========

Open source machine learning algorithms.

This is very, very alpha-level code at this point. Use at your own risk. Trust nothing. It will probably make your machine explode, and your cat throw up in your shoes.

Your contributions, criticisms, pull requests, patches, etc are very welcome.

So far, we have implemented: 

* ID3 decision tree + training (very simplistic, as the goal was to provide an underlying tree for the Random Forest)
* Random Forest algorithm, using underlying ID3 trees.
